# vncpwn
mIRC script for scanning vnc servers and bypass auth
put vncpwn.mrc in same directory as mIRC then type in status window: /load -rs vncpwn.mrc
make sure vnc.exe is in the same directory as well

or you can simply execute VNCPwn3r.exe as Administrator if you dont want to install mIRC and load the script manually
